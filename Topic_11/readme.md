## Introduction to BIOL525D - Bioinformatics for Evolutionary Biologists

*We have tried to keep jargon to a minimum, but if there are things that you want us to clarify or terms you want us to define please don't be afraid to ask!*

In this workshop, we aim to cover the basics of bioinformatics. This course is aimed at those who have some familiarity with computational tools.

There are a number of tools for applying bioinformatic tools with a graphical user interface (such as [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) and [Geneious](https://www.geneious.com/)). These programs are great and certainly have their place. However, I (Tom) would argue that learning how to use the command line is preferable as it provides far more flexibility and reproducibility and is also a highly transferable skill.

Admittedly, there is a very steep learning curve when it comes to the command line. The purpose of this workshop is not to teach you how to use the command line  *per se*, it takes a lot of practice and learning to get comfortable using the command line, so please do not hesitate to ask questions and please do not be put off if you find it opaque to begin with. The purpose of this workshop is to demonstrate the fundamental aspects of bioinformatics for evolutionary biology.

but rather to demonstrate how the bioinformatic analyses ca be conducted at the command line.  

In this first tutorial, we are going to use the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) to manually inspect several types of files that you may come across in bioinformatics.

IGV was developed and is maintained by the Broad Institute (who also maintain many other widely used packages). The IGV provides users with a graphical user interface (GUI) for inspecting and curating datasets. It's a remarkably flexible tool that is invaluable in many instances. Here's how the Broad describes it:

*The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance, easy-to-use, interactive tool for the visual exploration of genomic data. It supports flexible integration of all the common types of genomic data and metadata, investigator-generated or publicly available, loaded from local or cloud sources.*

The first thing that you need to do in this tutorial is to get IGV up and running on your machine.

IGV can be freely downloaded at: [https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/). There are pre-compiled
